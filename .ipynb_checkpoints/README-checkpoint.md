# Churn Model with TensorFlow

## Overview
This project focuses on building a churn prediction model using TensorFlow, a powerful machine learning library. The churn prediction model aims to predict whether customers will leave a telecommunications provider based on various features.

## Built with:
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- MatPlotLib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains information about telecommunications customers, including features such as state, account length, international plan, voice mail plan, and more. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features. Data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/customer-churn-prediction-2020.

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy and loss metrics. Here are the plots depicting the training and validation accuracy, as well as the training and validation loss over epochs:

## Conclusion:
The churn prediction model demonstrates promising results in predicting customer churn. Further optimization and fine-tuning may be necessary to improve its performance.
